Multi-Slider

Multi Slider is a slider that allows multiple/numerous slideshows to run all at once without intereferring with each other. Here are some features:

* onclick of a designated trigger (a square, link, image) in a series, will launch a pop-up with a designated slideshow. Currently, the slideshows run on an "id" system where you specify a name for a slideshow, and change the id of each element in the slideshow popup to match.
* The Wordpress version automatically populates all the data and IDs
* slideshow will pause on-change of slideshow


Requirements:

* Cycle.js for jQuery
* jQuery
* advanced custom fields plugin
