/* CSS Document */

/* The purpose of this class/these classes is to hide an element without using "display: none". It will enable preloading of the element (I think). And in case you're using 
a plugin that uses "display: none" on a parent element or sibling elements. This will keep the element out of view even if the display style is changed */

/* USES: hide elements you're still working on while keeping a website live */
