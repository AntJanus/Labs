Hello All,
My name is Antonin Januska and this is my Labs Repository. 
It's meant to host my code snippets, ideas, designs, and anything else that you and I will be able to reuse in our efforts to develop and design amazing applications, websites, interfaces, and much more. Feel free to fork me and add your own snippets.

My homepage url: http://antjanus.com/labs will feature these snippets plus links to demos.

Enjoy!
